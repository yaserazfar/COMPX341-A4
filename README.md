## Learning DevOps and Continuous Deployment on the Cloud using IBM Cloud

This application was made from following the IBM tutorial and then adding more features to it, such as the Map feature as well as using a Firebase Database to store the last searched city.

This React application can return weather for New Zealand cities using two different methods:
1. Searching for a city in the text box
2. Clicking on a city on the map and pressing enter in the text box

The application uses two APIs:
1. Google Maps API
2. OpenWeatherMap API


All API keys used in this project have been disabled.
